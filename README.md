# End-to-End Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Facial Emotion and FACS (Facial Action Coding System) Code Identification Using The Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+)
This project presents the development of an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of simultaneously recognizing facial emotions and decoding Facial Action Coding System (FACS) codes from facial images. Utilizing a subset of The Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+), renowned for its contributions to facial expression analysis, our methodology includes custom data generation, Haarcascades-based facial feature detection, and preprocessing techniques like GaussianBlur and Canny edge detection. To tackle class imbalance, we applied data augmentation and employed L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. Performance metrics tailored to each task, including accuracy, categorical cross-entropy loss, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves, were carefully selected to comprehensively evaluate the model's capabilities.
